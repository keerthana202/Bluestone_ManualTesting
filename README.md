# Bluestone_ManualTesting
While exploring the Bluestone website, I identified a bug that affects the user experience. As part of my mini project, I created a document to thoroughly document the issue, including visual evidence and steps to reproduce the bug. This document serves as a detailed report to help developers or the Bluestone team understand and resolve the issue.
